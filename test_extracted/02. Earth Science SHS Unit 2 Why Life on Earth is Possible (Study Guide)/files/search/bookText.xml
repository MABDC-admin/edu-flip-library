                 Possible








































                 Do  you  have  a  garden  at  home?  Our  moms  usually  have  a  green  thumb,  so  they  are
                 typically  the  one  in  charge  of  the  garden.  What  if  your  mom  bought  a  new  plant  but
                 she  will  not  be  around  for  days,  and  you  were  asked  to  take  care  of  this  plant?  How
                 are  you  going  to  make  this  plant  survive?  The  ﬁrst  thing  that  you  need  to  do  is  to
                 expose  it  to  an  area  where  the  plants  will  receive  enough  sunlight  and  air.  The  next
                 important   thing   is   to   water   them   every   day.   What   if   you   failed   to   do   these   two
                 important   things?   The   result   will   be   a   reprimand   from   your   mom   because   you

                 made her plant wilt.


                 Sunlight,   air   in   the   atmosphere,   and   water   are   the   basic   things   for   a   plant   to
                 survive.   Without   plants,   animals   and   other   organisms   that   depend   on   them   will
                 eventually   diminish   or   even   die.   In   the   case   of   humans   and   other   life   forms,

                              Essential Questions




                 At the end of this unit, you should be able to answer the following questions.


                     ●   What makes sunlight, air, and water essential for life on Earth to exist?
                     ●   Is there an inﬁnite supply of sunlight, air, and water?
                     ●   Can human activities aﬀect the supply of sunlight, air, and water?
                     ●   What can we contribute to conserve these three resources?




                              Review





                     ●   There  are  diﬀerent  theories  on  the  origin  of  the  universe.  These  are  the  big
                         bang   theory,   oscillating   universe   theory,   nebular   theory,   and   encounter
                         theory.
                            ○   The   big   bang   theory   suggests   that   the   universe   started   as   a
                                “singularity”—  an  area  predicted  to  be  in  the  core  of  a  black  hole  with
                                very high temperature and density
                            ○   The   oscillating   universe   theory   discusses   that   the   universe   is
                                expanding  and  will  contract  once  all  the  energy  after  the  big  bang  has
                                been   used  up,  only  to  expand  again  once  it  approaches  the  point  of
                                singularity
                            ○   The  nebular  theory  explains  that  the  solar  system  originated  from  a
                                nebula — a cloud made up of dust and ionized particles.
                            ○   The   encounter   theory   proposes   that   the   planets   formed   from   the
                                material   ejected   from   the   sun   during   an   encounter   with   another

                                celestial object.

                              Objectives

                              In this lesson, you should be able to:
                                ●     explain how Earth was formed according to accretion
                                     hypotheses; and
                                ●     diﬀerentiate homogenous and heterogenous accretion
                                     hypothesis.



                 Have   you   ever   built   a  snowman?  Whether  you  tried  it  yourself  or  just  watched  it
                 from   a   movie,   the  idea  of  making  one  is  simple.  You  just  roll  a  piece  of  snow  on
                 your  hand  to  form  a  sphere.  Then,  put  it  back  to  the  ground  and  roll  it.  Since  the
                 snow   is   likely   to   stick   to   itself,   your   small   sphere   can   grow   as  big  as  you  are  by
                 accumulating   snow  from  the  ground.  This  is  also  the  same  thing  that  happens  in
                 the  formation  of  planets.  Before  the  solar  system  is  formed,  stars  and  planets  exist
                 in  a  massive  cloud  of  dust  and  gas.  These  fragments  of  dust  and  gas  start  to  bump

                 into   each   other   forming   a   huge   piece   of   matter.   This   collision   is  the  start  of  the
                 process of accretion.  How does accretion forms the  planets?

                 Procedure:
                     1.   Use  a  string  to  hang  the  ball  on  the  ceiling.  Make  sure  that  the  ball  is  around
                         3   feet   above   the   ground.   This   ball   represents   the   particle   with   the   most
                         density and will draw another particle towards it.

                         watched by all students after the activity.
                     3.   Each   student   should   receive   one   color   card.  Then,  students  will  move  at  a
                         random   position   surrounding   the   ball.   Each   student   represents   a   particle

                         having   its   own   gravity.   The   arrangement   of   the   particles   from   heaviest   to
                         lightest  is:  black  -  red  -  yellow  -  brown  -  blue.  Remember  that  the  ball  is  the
                         heaviest  and  densest.  It  tends  to  pull  the  kids  towards  it  and  towards  each
                         other.
                     4.   Students  will  now  move  towards  the  ball  depending  on  the  number  of  steps
                         written   on   their  card.  Make  sure  that  each  step  will  be  from  heel  to  toe.  If
                         they  hit  another  student  while  taking  steps  toward  the  ball,  they  will  combine
                         to  create  a  larger  particle  by  getting  the  sum  of  the  number  written  on  their
                         card.   For   example,   a   student   with   a   yellow  card   (3)  bumps  into  a  student
                         with a brown card (1), together they will move 3 + 1 = 4 steps.


                         Note:  The  ball's  gravity  is  so  strong  that  each  student  representing  a  particle
                         wants   to  put  one  hand  on  the  ball.  If  a  student  cannot  reach  the  ball,  that
                         student  can  just  put  their  hand  on  the  shoulder  of  the  person  touching  the
                         ball.   Take   note   that   the   students   touching   the   ball   directly   forms   the   ﬁrst
                         layer.   The   second   layer   is   formed   by   the   students   who   are   touching   the
                         shoulders  of  the  person  that  is  touching  the  ball  directly.  If  the  shoulders  of
                         the   students   in  the  ﬁrst  layer  are  full,  other  less  massive  students  can  just

                         touch the shoulders of those students in the second layer and so on.


                     5.   Stop when you are attached to the ball already.

                 In  a  carnival  or  fair,  there  is  usually  a  man  with  a  cotton  candy  machine.  When  you
                 have  seen  them  making  one,  you  can  observe  that  sugars  tend  to  stick  to  itself  as  it
                 spin  in  the  machine  and  form  a  large  cotton  candy.  Planet  formation  is  similar  to
                 this.  The  accumulation  of  small  pieces  of  dust  forming  huge  lumps  of  matter  is  a

                 process known as accretion.


                 Accretion  happens  when  gravity  attracts  tiny  bits  of  matter  towards  an  object.  This
                 results   in   a   gradual   increase   of   the   object’s   size.   In  relation  to  the  solar  system
                 formation,  the  objects  increase  its  size  until  it  turns  into  planets  and  stars.  As  the
                 objects  grow  bigger,  it  pulls  more  fragments  of  matter  due  to  stronger  gravitational
                 pull.

                 As   shown   in   Fig.   1,   accretion   happens   in   four   steps.   First,   clumps   of  dust  grains
                 collide   forming   planetesimals   and   eventually   turn   into   protoplanet   as   more
                 planetesimals  are  attracted.  A  protoplanet  is  a  planetary  embryo  that  consists  of
                 collection of matter, from which a planet is formed.


                 There   are  two  hypotheses  on  how  the  structure  of  Earth  was  formed  which  both
                 involves accretion: homogeneous and heterogeneous accretion hypotheses.


                 Homogeneous Accretion Hypothesis
                 The  homogeneous  accretion  hypothesis  states  that  the  formation  of  Earth  began
                 after   the   condensation   of   ﬁne   particles   of   the   primitive  nebula  about  4.6  billion
                 years  ago  .  When  these  particles  accreted,  they  formed  a  homogeneous  primordial
                 Earth.  Thus,  early  Earth  had  a  uniform  solid  composition.  Its  primary  components
                 were   iron,   magnesium,   nickel,   silicates,   and   some   radioactive   elements   such   as

                 uranium   and   thorium.   Due   to   gravitational   contraction   and   decay   of   radioactive
                 elements,   the   temperature   of   early   Earth   increased.   Iron   and   nickel  melted,  and
                 they  sank  towards  the  center  because  of  its  high  density.  On  the  other  hand,  less
                 dense silicates were displaced, and moved upwards.


                 In  this  hypothesis,  it  took  many  years  for  iron  and  nickel  to  accumulate  and  reach
                 the  center  of  about  4000  miles  deep.  During  this  time,  Earth’s  surface  experienced
                 turmoil,   violent   earthquakes,   continual   volcanic   eruptions,   and   covering   of   the
                 surface   with   ﬂowing   lava.   Eventually,   iron   and   nickel   accumulated   and   formed
                 Earth’s  core.  After  cooling  down,  a  thin  layer  of  solid  rock  formed  the  crust  including
                 the  continental  and  ocean  basins.  In  between  the  core  and  the  crust  is  the  mantle,
                 which is made up of semi-molten silicate rocks and other minerals.

                 Fig.   2   shows   a   summary   of   the   homogeneous   accretion  hypothesis.  First,  similar
                 elements   attached   to   each   other,   forming   a   solid   mass.   Second,   particles   were
                 melted  due  to  the  heat  produced  in  the  process.  Lastly,  heavier  elements  descend
                 to the center due to gravity, forming the solid core of Earth.
















                 Heterogeneous Accretion Hypothesis
                 The  heterogeneous  accretion  hypothesis  states  that  the  core  has  formed  at  the
                 same  time  as  Earth.  Therefore,  early  Earth  had  its  basic  layered  structure  with  core,

                 mantle, and crust.


                 According  to  this  theory,  as  the  nebula  cooled  down,  its  particles  have  condensed
                 depending   on   their   condensation   points.   Oxides   of   aluminum   and   calcium
                 condensed  ﬁrst,  followed  by  iron  and  nickel.  When  the  nebula  cooled  further,  the
                 silicates  condensed.  The  condensed  particles  collided  with  each  other  and  accreted.
                 The   formed   particles     during   the   initial   stage   of   condensation   accreted   ﬁrst.
                 Following   this,   aluminum   and   calcium   oxides  accreted  ﬁrst  then  followed  by  iron
                 and   nickel   to   form   Earth’s   core.   The   outermost  layer  is  composed  of  silicates,  as
                 well as volatile particles including water.

                 The  more  commonly  accepted  postulate  is  the  homogeneous  accretion  hypothesis.
                 Most   materials   that   formed   early   Earth   homogeneously   accreted   after   their
                 complete   condensation.   After   the   formation   of   early   Earth,   collisions   with
                 meteorites and comets resulted to the presence of volatile elements on the surface.



                 Earth   is   considered   as   a   dynamic   planet.   It   continuously   changes   ever   since   its
                 formation   4.6   billion   years   ago.   Through   time,   several   changes   happened   in   the

                              In this lesson, you should be able to:
                                ●     explain why water is considered as the medium of life;
                                ●     discuss the origin of water formation on Earth; and
                                ●     enumerate the uses of water.



                 Have   you   heard   of   a   ﬁreproof   balloon?   Most   of   us   know   that   when   an   inﬂated
                 balloon  is  near  a  source  of  heat,  it  will  explode  immediately.  Therefore,  making  it
                 ﬁreproof  is  a  nice  trick.  You  don’t  need  any  complicated  materials  for  you  to  be  able
                 to  do  this  trick.  Just  pour  water  into  the  balloon  before  you  inﬂate  it.  Then,  place  the
                 part   of  the  balloon  with  water  on  the  source  of  heat.  Those  who  are  not  familiar
                 with  the  properties  of  water  will  be  amazed  because  the  balloon  will  not  explode.

                              Learn about It





                 Earth  is  also  known  as  the  blue  planet  because  two-thirds  of  it  is  covered  by  water.
                 Even  it  is  abundant,  humans  should  still  conserve  and  not  abuse  water  resources.
                 Conservation   of   water   resources   is   important   because   all   life   forms   depend   on
                 water   in   various   ways   such   as   drinking,   irrigation,   food   preparation,   hygiene,
                 watering plants, and many more.



                 It   is   undeniable   that   water   plays  an  important  role  for  all  living  organisms  in  the
                 planet.   Since   the   prehistoric   stage,   human   beings   depend   on   water   for   the
                 development. Therefore, life is not possible on Earth without water.


                 Hydrosphere
                 The   water   environment   on   Earth   is   known   as   the   hydrosphere  .   At   present,   all
                 water   on   Earth   (water   vapor,   liquid   water,   and   ice)  comprise  the  hydrosphere.  It
                 includes   all   bodies   of   water   such   as   oceans,   lakes,   rivers,   and   marshes.   Clouds,
                 snow,  glacier,  and  rain  are  also  part  of  the  hydrosphere.  Hydrosphere  is  comprised
                 of 97.5% saltwater and 2.5% freshwater.

                 As  the  name  implies,  salt  water  is  composed  of  certain  amount  of  salt.  Saltwater
                 comprises  the  oceans  and  seas.  The  ocean  houses  many  species  of  marine  life  and
                 diverse  mineral  resources.  If  you  are  fond  of  diving,  you  know  how  much  diversity  is
                 there  under  the  sea.  A  lot  of  organisms  depend  on  saltwater  for  survival  such   as
                 saltwater  ﬁshes  and  other  marine  invertebrates.  Since  some  people  are  attracted  to
                 the  wonder  of  the  sea,  some  wants  to  keep  saltwater  organisms  in  their  aquarium.
                 If  you  are  one  of  these  people,  you  should  know  that  utmost  care  is  needed  since
                 marine animals are sensitive to the quality of water.



                 Freshwater
                 Contrary  to  the  popular  belief  that  the  freshwater  is  devoid  of  salt,  freshwater  still
                 has   small   amount   of   salts   but   in   very   low   concentrations.   Freshwater   can   be
                 present   in   the   form   of   rain   and   snow,   and   it   can  even  be  found  in  permanently
                 frozen  soil  known  as  permafrost.  It  is  commonly  stored  in  rivers,  streams,  ponds,
                 lakes, marshes, glaciers, and polar caps.


                 Despite  the  abundance  of  water  on  earth,  only  a  small  amount  of  Earth’s  water  is
                 accessible  as  freshwater.  It  only  accounts  for  2.5%  of  the  total  water  on  Earth.  Out
                 of  this  total  percentage,  only  1%  of  freshwater  is  potable.  This  percentage  will  be
                 constant   since   water   is   continually   recycled   through   the   atmosphere.   However,
                 increasing population yields to growing competition on clean water resource.


                 Properties of Water That Enable Existence of Life
                 Water   provided   optimum   environment  for  the  existence  of  the  ﬁrst  life  forms  on
                 Earth.   Water   dissolved   early   Earth   molecules   which   reacted   and   formed   more
                 complex  molecules.  Water  has  the  right  density,  transition  temperatures,  and  heat
                 capacity that enable existence and perpetuation of life in the planet.



                 Density
                 Density   is   measured   as   mass   per  unit  of  volume  (in  g/cm³).  The  density  of  water
                 changes  with  several  factors  such  as  temperature  and  salinity.  Water  is  densest  at
                 3.98°C and is least dense at freezing  temperature.


                 Ice   ﬂoats   on   the   surface   of   liquid   water   because   ice   has   a   lower   density.   Ice
                 insulates  the  underlying  liquid  and  prevents  the  liquid  from  further  freezing.  If  ice
                 sinks  when  frozen,  then  the  surface  of  the  liquid  water  will  freeze  and  sink  again
                 until such point that all water will be frozen, making chemical reactions impossible.





                                                                                                           18]]></page><page Index="19"><![CDATA[When  the  lakes  start  to  freeze  during  winter,  people  can  skate  on  that  frozen  lake.  If

                 will be dead.

                 Transition Temperatures
                 All  life  forms  are  composed  of  cells  in  which  their  cell  membrane  separates  them
                 from   the   environment.   The   cell   membrane   is   important   to   selectively   take   in
                 important   substances   and   prevent   toxic   products   to   go   in.   In   this   case,   the
                 consistency  of  water  in  maintaining  liquid  form  at  room  temperatures  is  important
                 as   it  allows  ﬂow  and  transfer  of  substances  from  the  cell  to  its  environment  and
                 vice versa.


                 Heat Capacity
                 When   you   go   to   the   beach   especially  on  a  hot  day,  you  will  notice  that  the  sand
                 heats   faster   than   the   sea.   This   is   because   water   needs   a  higher  amount  of  heat
                 before  its  temperature  is  raised  by  one  degree.  This  high  heat  capacity  of  water  is
                 also  the  reason  why  it  is  important  in  vehicle  engines.  It  is  an  excellent  coolant  since
                 high  amount  of  heat  energy  can  be  absorbed  without  getting  too  hot.  In  addition,

                 this  property  is  the  reason  why  the  ﬁreproof  balloon  trick  is  possible.  Unlike  the  air
                 in   the   balloon,   the   water   inside   needs   higher   amount   of   heat   before   its
                 temperature is increased causing the explosion of balloon.


                 The   water’s   high   heat   capacity   is   important   because,   without   this   property,   the
                 atmosphere   will   be   extremely   cold   during   winter   and   extremely   hot   during

                 importantly,   cells   in   our   bodies   are   composed   of   mostly   water   that   allows   the
                 maintenance   of   constant   temperature   intracellularly.   Therefore,   if   water   doesn’t
                 have  a  high  heat  capacity,  our  temperature  can  get  too  high  quickly  which  can   be
                 highly detrimental to most organisms.














                 Hypothesis on the Origin of Water on Earth

                 The  prevailing  hypothesis  on  the  origin  of  water  on  Earth  suggests  that  water  came
                 from   comets   that   collided   with   Earth.   In  2000,  scientists  investigating  LINEAR  S-4
                 comet   had   discovered   that   water   from   the   comet   had   the   same   isotopic
                 composition  as  the  water  in  the  seas.  (Recall  that  isotopes  are  atoms  with  the  same
                 number of protons but diﬀerent number of neutrons.)


                 Other  studies  suggest  that  water  was  already  present  within  Earth  since  formation
                 as   volatiles   trapped   in   magma,   and   manifested   as   liquid   water  during  degassing
                 after the crust had formed. The truth may be a mixture of both theories.


                 Uses of Water in Modern Civilizations
                 In   modern   civilizations,   water   has   a   variety   of   uses.   Water   is   commonly   used   in
                 agriculture   for   the   irrigation   of   crops.   About   70%   of   global   freshwater   use  is  for
                 agricultural  purposes.  For  industrial  purposes,  about  20%  of  water  is  used  globally.
                 Every   product   that   is   manufactured   utilizes   water   throughout   the   production
                 process   such   as   fabricating,   washing,   cooling,   transporting   a  product,  integrating
                 water   into   a   product,   and   sanitizing   the   manufacturing   facility.   For   domestic
                 purposes,   about   10%   of   freshwater   is   used   for   drinking   water,   washing   dishes,

                 brushing  teeth,  and  bathing.  As  shown  in  Fig.  6,  water  usage  for  diﬀerent  purposes
                 varies among countries.

                              Key Points




                     ●   Hydrosphere   is   the   water   environment   on   Earth.  It  is  comprised  of  97.5%
                         saltwater and 2.5% freshwater.
                     ●   Salt  water  is  composed  of  certain  amount  of  salt.  It  comprises  the  oceans
                         and seas.

                     ●   Freshwater   has   still   amount   of   salts   but   in   very   low   concentrations.
                         Freshwater  can  be  present  in  the  form  of  rain  and  snow,  and  it  can  even  be
                         found  in  permanently  frozen  soil  known  as  permafrost.  It  can  also  be  stored
                         in rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, marshes, glaciers, and polar caps.
                     ●   Water  has  the  right  density,  transition  temperatures,  and  heat  capacity
                         that enable existence and perpetuation of life.
                     ●   The   prevailing   hypothesis   on   the   origin   of   water   on   Earth   suggests   that
                         water   came   from   comets   that   collided   with   Earth.   Other  studies  suggest

                              In this lesson, you should be able to:
                                ●     describe the sun as the major source of energy;
                                ●     deﬁne what is Earth’s energy budget; and
                                ●     identify the factors aﬀecting Earth’s energy budget.



                 Have   you   ever   tried   sunbathing?   You   might   be   one   of   those   people   who   spend
                 summer  breaks  going  to  the  beach  and  do  sunbathing.  It  is  undeniably  a  nice  way
                 of   relaxation   and   appreciation   of   nature.   If  sunbathing  is  a  leisure  for  people,  to
                 plants,   sunbathing   is   an   important   step   to   sustain   life.   In   fact,   plants   have
                 developed   variety   of   ways  to  maximize  the  use  of  sunlight  exposure  while  at  the
                 same time, preventing water loss.


                 It   is   undebatable   that   the   sun   provides   each   living   thing   with   the   essential
                 necessities  of  life  on  Earth.  How  do  humans  obtain  this  life-sustaining  nourishment?
                 That's  where  photosynthesis  ,  a  process  that  involves  the  capture  and  use  of  the

                 sun’s   energy   to   create   biological   compounds,   comes   into   place.   Everything   is
                 related   in   the   process.   When   the   sun   shines,   plants   capture   sunlight  and  obtain
                 carbon   dioxide   from   the   atmosphere   and   water   in   the   soil.   In   return,   plants
                 produce  sugar  and  oxygen  that  are  essential  for  living  organisms.  Then,  the  cycle
                 persists for as long as the sun shines.


                 The  important  role  of  the  sun  in  photosynthesis  is  just  one  of  the  countless  beneﬁts
                 that   we   can   get   from   the   sun.   All   life   forms   depend   on   the   sun's   warmth   for
                 survival.   What   would   life   be   without   the   sun?   Will   there   be   life   in   the   ﬁrst
                 place?

                              Learn about It





                 On  a  hot  sunny  day,  wearing  a  black  clothing  adds  heat  to  your  body  than  when  you

                 are  wearing  a  light  colored  clothing.  The  science  behind  this  is  because  of  albedo.
                 Albedo  is  the  ability  of  a  material  to  reﬂect  light.  Therefore,  a  high  albedo  means
                 that   a   material   can   reﬂect   light   more   than   a   material   with   low   albedo.   Black
                 surfaces   have   low  albedo  since  it  absorbs  more  sunlight  and  its  associated  heat
                 than the light colored surfaces.


                 Albedo   can   be   measured   on   a   scale   of   0   to   1.   Values   closer   to   0  means  that   a
                 material  absorbs  all  the  light  while  a  value  of  1  means  that  a  material  reﬂects  all  the
                 light.  This  is  why  black  surfaces  such  as  asphalt  have  values  closer  to  0  while  light
                 colored surfaces such as white paint or ice has values closer to 1.

                 function   properly.   This   is   true   to   most   organisms   especially   to   plants   since   it
                 capture   the   sun's  energy  to  produce  food.  However,  too  much  heat  is  damaging.
                 Therefore,   using   your   knowledge   of   albedo   might   help   to   avoid   too   much   heat
                 exposure.  An  example  is  to  paint  the  roof  and  wall  of  your  house  with  a  white  color.
                 This helps in keeping your house cooler since white surfaces reﬂect more light.


                 Uses of Solar Energy
                 The sun is the primary source of energy on Earth. This energy is required for almost

                 Even  before  the  modern  civilization,  sun  is  undeniably  an  essential  part  of  human
                 lives.   Moreover,   sun   played   a   role   in   many   mythologies   and   even   systems   of
                 worship.   Since   people   consider   it   as  a  bringer  of  light  and  life,  sun  has  been  the
                 central   deity   of  humankind.  However,  as  time  goes  by,  people  no  longer  worship
                 the sun, but its importance did not subside.

                 die.  People  who  consume  herbivores  such  as  cows,  will  also  be  aﬀected.  In  addition,
                 sunlight  converts  molecule  precursors  in  your  skin  to  produce  vitamin  D,  which  is
                 responsible for bone maintenance.


                 Solar  energy  also  warms  Earth.  It  is
                 one   of   the   the   driving   forces   of
                 weather   and   climate.   The   sun’s
                 energy   is   transferred   across   an

                 empty   space   or  vacuum  to  Earth’s
                 surface        through       radiation.
                 Radiation   is   the   transfer   of   heat
                 through   electromagnetic   waves.
                 This     heat     is     essential     in
                 regulating Earth’s temperature  .


                 The  abundance  of  solar  energy  will
                 be  put  into  waste  if  we  will  not  take
                 advantage   of   it.   Since   it   is   a
                 renewable   resource,   supply   of
                 solar  energy  will  never  run  out.  As
                 long   as   the   sun   shines,   solar
                 energy  is  available  for  everyone  to
                 utilize.   Through   advancement   of
                 technology,      people     can     now
                 harness   solar   energy   by  means  of
                 solar   panels.   This   is   a   signiﬁcant

                 Planning  budget  is  important  especially  if  you  are  the  bread  winner  of  the  family.
                 You  need  to  ensure  that  your  income  will  tally  to  the  expenses  spent  and  savings
                 kept.   This   also   holds   true   for   Earth's   energy   budget.   It   needs   to   ensure   that
                 absorbed  solar  radiation  is  balanced  to  the  radiated  ones.  Keeping  Earth’s  energy
                 budge  t  ensures  that  the  average  temperature  on  Earth  remains  stable  and  that  life
                 continues to exist.


                 Earth's  albedo  is  0.3.  Thirty  percent  of  the  solar  energy  that  reaches  the  surface  of
                 Earth  is  reﬂected  back  to  space  by  the  clouds,  atmosphere,  and  light-colored  areas

                 (deserts   and   areas   covered   with   ice   and   snow).   The   remaining   70%   of   the   solar
                 energy   is   absorbed   by   the   atmosphere,   land,   and   oceans.   The   absorbed   energy
                 drives  wind  and  ocean  currents.  These  currents  distribute  the  heat  throughout  the
                 planet  since  more  sunlight  shines  on  equatorial  region  than  polar  regions.  All  this
                 solar  energy  absorbed  by  the  atmosphere,  air,  land  and  oceans  must  be  radiated
                 back to space. Therefore, energy in should always equal to energy out.

                 There  are  certain  factors  that  aﬀect  Earth’s  energy  budget  such  as  the  amount  of
                 light   colored   surfaces,   amount   of   radiation   received,   Earth’s   axial   tilt,   and   the

                 presence  of  greenhouse  gases.  Recall  that  light-colored  areas  enable  the  reﬂection
                 of   solar   energy.   Therefore,   when   the   size   of   these   areas   is   altered,   then   energy
                 balance is also aﬀected.


                 Energy   balance   can   also   be   aﬀected  when  the  amount  of  radiation  received  by
                 Earth  from  the  sun  changes.  For  instance,  the  changes  in  Earth’s  orbit  and  axial  tilt
                 led to a series of ice ages over the last million years.


                 Earth’s   axial   tilt   also   aﬀects   the   amount   of   radiation   coming   from   the   Sun.
                 Throughout  the  year,  the  orientation  of  Earth  toward  the  sun  changes  due  to  the
                 23.5°  vertical  tilt  of  its  axis,  causing  the  position  of  the  sun  across  the  sky  to  wander
                 at   about   47°.   This   change   has   a   direct   eﬀect   on   the   intensity   of   insolation.
                 Insolation  is  the  amount  of  solar  radiation  that  reaches  a  given  area.  Simply  put,  it
                 is   the   exposure   to   the   sun’s   rays.   For   instance,   if   the   sun   is   located   directly

                 overhead,   then   the   intensity   of   insolation   is   higher   as   compared  when  the  sun’s
                 altitude  across  the  sky  is  about  45°  wherein  the  sun’s  rays  are  spread  over  a  larger
                 area.   This   explains   why   areas   within   or   near   the   equator   experience   higher
                 amounts of solar radiation, making the areas warmer.


                 Lastly,  the  energy  balance  is  aﬀected  by  the  presence  of  greenhouse  gases  such  as
                 methane,  nitrous  oxide,  ozone,  water  vapor,  and  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere.
                 These  gases  trap  solar  energy  which  should  have  been  reﬂected  back  to  space.  The
                 increase  of  greenhouse  gases  would  mean  that  more  energy  is  trapped,  and  some
                 energy   are   re-emitted   in   all   directions,   thus,   heating   Earth.   This   heating
                 phenomenon is known as the greenhouse eﬀect.

                 The energy of the sun is released through ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation.
                 About  44%  of  the  radiant  energy  emitted  by  the  sun  is  in  the  form  of  visible  light;
                 49%  is  in  the  form  of  near-infrared,  far-infrared,  microwave,  and  radio  waves;  and
                 the remaining 7% accounts for ultraviolet radiation.

                 atmosphere   is   the   thin   skin.   This   thin   layer   is   what   protects   us   from   harmful

                 Layers of the Atmosphere

                 Despite   being   thin,   atmosphere   could   still   be   divided   into   layers.   The   layers   are
                 troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.


                 Troposphere
                 The  troposphere  is  the  layer  closest  to  Earth.  The  term  troposphere  comes  from
                 the   Greek   word   “  tropos  ”   which   means   change.   It   is   called   such   because   of   the
                 persistently  changing  weather  in  this  layer  of  the  atmosphere.  Its  thickness  varies
                 depending  on  your  location  on  Earth,  but  the  range  is  between  5  and  9  miles  (8  and
                 14 km). Temperature gets cooler as you go higher in the atmosphere.

                 relatively   high   atmospheric   pressure   which   allows   high  concentrations  of  oxygen

                                             Fig. 14.  Layers of the atmosphere.


                 Stratosphere
                 The  stratosphere  is  the  next  layer  which  is  about  35  km  thick.  As  opposed  to  the
                 troposphere, the temperature in this layer gets warmer as you go higher.


                 An  important  feature  of  this  layer  is  the  ozone  layer  which  protects  Earth  from  the

                 sun’s   harmful   UV   radiation.   However,   insulating   foams,   air   conditioners,
                 refrigerators   and   other   things   manufactured   by   industries   that   use
                 chloroﬂuorocarbons   (CFCs)   which   causes   ozone   depletion.   As   CFCs   reach   the
                 stratosphere,   it  will  be  broken  down  by  the  sun’s  UV  radiation  releasing  chlorine.
                 These   chlorine   atoms   react   and   destroy   the   ozone.   A   total   of   100   000   ozone
                 molecules can be broken apart by just a single chlorine atom.

                 inhaled,  ozones  can  irritate  the  lungs  and  breakdown  lung  tissues.  Plants  are  also
                 aﬀected by this tropospheric ozone.

                 Mesosphere
                 The   mesosphere   comes   from  the  word  “meso”  which  means  middle.  This  35  km
                 thick  layer  is  termed  as  the  coldest  layer  because  it  has  a  minimum  temperature  of
                 roughly   -85   degrees   Celsius.   The   reason   behind   this   low   temperature   is   the
                 lessened solar heat and high cooling due to carbon dioxide.


                 Meteor  shower  or  also  known  as  the  shooting  stars  are  meteors  burning  up  in  the
                 mesosphere.  This  layer  protects  Earth  from  the  impact  of  those  space  debris.   The
                 debris burns as a result of the frictional force between air and debris molecules.

                 The   thermosphere   comes   from   the   word   “thermo”   which   means   heat.
                 Thermosphere  is  roughly  600  km  thick  and  can  reach  a  temperature  of  about  1500
                 degrees   Celsius.   Moreover,   the   thermosphere   regulates   temperature   and   ﬁlters
                 X-rays  and  some  ultraviolet  radiation  emitted  by  the  sun.  Another  interesting  fact  is
                 that the International Space Station orbits through this layer.


                 Exosphere
                 The  exosphere  comes  from  the  word  “exo”  which  means  outside.  This  10,000  km
                 thick   outermost   layer   forms   a   boundary   between   Earth   and   space.   Exosphere  is

                 very thick so going to space is really too far.


                 This   farthest  layer  absorbs  some  radiation  and  protects  the  layers  underneath.  It
                 contains   hydrogen   and   helium.   The   air   is   almost   similar   to   the  vacuum  in  space
                 because it is so thin.

















                 Considering   the   climate,   the   most   important   layer   of   the   atmosphere   is   the
                 boundary  layer  composed  of  troposphere  and  stratosphere.  The  boundary  layer  is
                 just  next  to  Earth’s  surface.  The  energy  transferred  from  Earth’s  surface  in  the  form
                 of  conduction  or  even  moisture  from  evapotranspiration  stays  within  this  boundary
                 and is not transferred to higher atmosphere.


                 Characteristics of the Atmosphere that Enable Life on Earth
                 The   atmosphere   is   crucial   in   enabling   and  maintaining  life  on  Earth.  Without  the
                 atmosphere,  Earth  would  look  like  the  moon.  There  would  be  no  life  forms  existing

                 on Earth.


                 Atmospheric  gases,  such  as  carbon  dioxide  and  oxygen,  are  needed  by  organisms.
                 Carbon  dioxide  is  used  by  photosynthetic  organisms,  such  as  plants  and  algae,  to
                 convert   the   energy   from   the   sun   to   usable   energy   through   the   process   of
                 photosynthesis.   On   the   other  hand,  oxygen  is  required  by  some  living  organisms

                 The  ozone  layer  in  the  stratosphere  is  necessary  in  enabling  life  on  Earth.  Without
                 this  layer,  harmful  rays  from  the  sun  would  reach  the  surface  of  Earth  and  prevent
                 most  organisms  from  surviving.  Together  with  the  oceans,  the  atmosphere  keeps
                 Earth’s temperature within the suitable range for life forms.


                 Atmosphere’s Role in the Hydrologic Cycle
                 Water   is   a   renewable   resource   because   it   is   continually   circulated   across   Earth
                 through   a   process   known   as   the   hydrologic   cycle.   Its   three   main   important

                 processes are evaporation, condensation and precipitation.


                 Hydrologic Cycle
                 One  important  process  of  this  cycle  is  evaporation.  Evaporation  is  the  process  of
                 converting   liquid  to  gas.  Water  from  the  oceans,  lakes,  streams,  rivers,  and  other
                 bodies  of  water  undergo  this  process,  and  it  becomes  atmospheric  water  vapor.  In
                 plants, instead of evaporation, the process of evapotranspiration takes place.

                 (humidity).   Cloud   formation   happens   by   converting   water   vapor   to   liquid   form
                 through a process called  condensation.


                 Another  part  of  the  cycle  is  precipitation  .  It  is  the  process  of  releasing  water  from
                 the   clouds   in   the   form   of   rain,   snow,   sleet,   or  hail.  It  is  the  process  of  returning
                 water  from  the  atmosphere  back  to  Earth’s  surface.  Once  returned  to  the  surface,
                 liquid  water  may  runoﬀ  the  surface  into  streams  and  reservoirs  such  as  lakes  and
                 oceans.   Water   may   then   inﬁltrate   the   subsurface   and   be   incorporated   into   the
                 groundwater  system.  It  may  be  consumed  and  stored  in  organisms,  or  trapped  in

                 glaciers.


                 The   atmosphere   is   a   crucial   part   of   the   water   cycle.  It  serves  as  the  reservoir  of
                 large   amounts   of   water.   The   water   cycle   or   hydrologic   cycle   describes   the
                 movement  of  water  from  one  area  to  another  by  changing  states―liquid  to  vapor
                 to   ice   and   back   again.   It   is   a   never-ending   cycle  that  has  occurred  for  billions  of
                 years. All living things depends on this continuous cycle.


                 Therefore, the atmosphere is an eﬃcient medium to move water around the globe.

                  Accretion                  It   happens   when   gravity   attracts   tiny   bits   of   matter
                                             towards  an  object.  This  will  result  to  gradual  increase  of
                                             the object’s size.

                  Albedo                     It is the ability of a material to reﬂect light.

                  Exosphere                  It   absorbs   some   radiation   and   protects   the   layers
                                             underneath.

                  Heterogeneous              It   states   that   Earth   accreted   during   condensation,
                  accretion                  forming a diﬀerentiated planet as it grew in size.
                  Homogeneous                It   states  that  Earth  accreted  from  materials  of  the  same

                  accretion                  composition   after   condensation.   Accretion  was  followed
                                             by diﬀerentiation.
                  Hydrosphere                It is the water environment on Earth.

                  Mesosphere                 It protects Earth from the impact of space debris.


                  Stratosphere               It   is  where  the  ozone  layer  that  protects  Earth  from  the
                                             sun’s harmful UV radiation is found.
                  Thermosphere               It   regulates   temperature   and   ﬁlters   X-rays   and   some

                                             ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun.
                  Troposphere                It   is   the   atmospheric   layer   where   humans   live.   It   also
                                             regulates weather and climate.
